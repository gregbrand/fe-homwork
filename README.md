# Star Wars: Planetary Explorer with Nuxt 3 & Pinia

## Introduction:

Greetings, Young Padawan! The galaxy is vast, and the Force has brought you here for a critical mission. As part of your test, you have been tasked to create an application that uses the SWAPI (Star Wars API) to list all the planets in the galaxy and their inhabitants. Harness the power of the Nuxt 3, Vue 3 Composition API, and Pinia to complete this task. May the Force be with you!

## A quick note

As you embark on this challenge, you're getting a snapshot of the direction we're heading. Our toolkit is Nuxt 3, Pinia, and the Tailwind.css. And here's a bit of insider info: We're ramping up to dive deep into this exciting tech stack very soon.

This test is vital as your code will play a foundational role in an application intended for millions of users in the future. Yeah, itâ€™s that big. But donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll have great mentors along the way. 

If you come from a background of React and Next.js, or perhaps another frontend framework, you'll find that some elements of this challenge will seem familiar. While the syntax might be a different twist, the foundational concepts should strike a chord with your previous experience.

Now, here's the real talk. We don't expect this challenge to be perfectly solved in every way. What we're genuinely eager to see is the best you can bring to the table within a specific window - let's say 4-5 hours max.

## Requirements:

1. Fetching Data: Use the SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/) to fetch data about planets and their residents. You can find the documentation here: https://swapi.dev/documentation
2. We're big fans of Nuxt 3 and the Composition API, so they're a must-have for this challenge. But hey, if you're not into using Tailwind.css or Pinia, that's okay! Though, a little birdie told us that those who do might just get a gold star. ðŸ˜‰

## Objective:

Develop a website that: 

1. Lists all the Star Wars planets.
2. Displays planet info (+ list the inhabitants) of each planet when clicked upon.

## What you need to build? 

1. Planets List: Display an organized list of planets, each labeled with its iconic name. Now, here's a little insider info: SWAPI isn't handing out planet selfies. So, feel free to use a simple placeholder image for each world. If you're in the mood to drop in a Star Wars-themed touch, go for it! Just remember, while we love a splash of creativity, the star of the show is still a smooth user experience and the overall feel.
2. Planet details: Journey deeper into the galaxy! ðŸŒŒ When a user selects a planet from your list, guide them to a dedicated page that showcases the planet's details and its inhabitants. For instance, if someone selects Tatooine, they should hyperspace to /planet/tatooine. On this page, lay out some intriguing facts about the planet and list the inhabitants. 

## Bonus Points:

1. Incorporate error handling and loading states. For example, show a loading spinner while fetching data and display an error message if the fetch fails.
2. Implement a "favorites" feature, where users can favorite planets and view them in a separate list. Use localStorage. 

## Design:

Functionality remains paramount, but don't hesitate to add your creative touch to the design. However, we recognize that you're not applying for a designer role and time might be limited. Do your best within the time constraints.

## What is in the template repo?

Just a freshly installed nuxt 3 app with the tailwind and pinia added to it. 

## Submission:

Please submit a link to your GitHub repository via Github Classroom. 

Remember, the Force will be with you, always. Good luck, and may your code be strong and bug-free! ðŸš€
